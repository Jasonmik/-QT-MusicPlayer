[00:07.85]When it's late at night
[00:11.91]Do you recall that night?
[00:16.05]'cause I think about it sometimes
[00:20.97]I'm just lying, it's all the time, babe.
[00:25.84]I found out the way to your heart
[00:30.58]And found myself completely lost
[00:34.69]Whatever, it doesn't matter, we fine
[00:36.99]I don't need to label how we good time
[00:39.01]And we don't need to tell nobody we ride
[00:41.35]'cause **** it, we're young, it's just fun.
[00:43.57]It started off just a touch innocent
[00:47.60]Like friends, like friends, yeah
[00:52.09]Wake up here, tired, horizontal
[00:55.30]We just friends, just friends
[01:00.85]Maybe one drink, nothing too far gone (too far)
[01:05.06]Is it the stars saying fall in love, no
[01:09.61]We don't say much as we lay here
[01:12.86]We just friends, just friends.
[01:17.58]When you say my name
[01:21.14]So casual touch, my hand
[01:26.19]I stop and play it cool
[01:28.42]Like I'm not into you
[01:31.08]But I'm just lying
[01:32.63]You drive me wild and say.
[01:35.92]I found out the way to your heart
[01:40.35]And found myself completely lost
[01:44.60]Whatever, it doesn't matter, we fine
[01:46.78]I don't need to label how we good time
[01:48.93]And we don't need to tell nobody we ride
[01:50.89]'cause **** it, we're young, it's just fun.
[01:53.37]It started off just a touch innocent
[01:57.21]Like friends, like friends, yeah
[02:02.01]Wake up here, tired, horizontal
[02:05.25]We just friends, just friends
[02:10.60]Maybe one drink, nothing too far gone (too far)
[02:15.08]Is it the stars saying fall in love, no
[02:19.59]We don't say much as we lay here
[02:22.86]We just friends, just friends.
