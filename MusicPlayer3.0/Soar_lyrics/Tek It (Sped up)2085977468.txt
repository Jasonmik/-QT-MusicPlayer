[00:00.000]Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
[00:05.642]And how much can I be expected to tolerate?
[00:10.772]So I started to think about the plans I made, the debt unpaid
[00:17.077]And you just can't call a spade a spade
[00:22.804]I watch the moon
[00:26.969]let it run my mood
[00:29.713]Can't stop thinking of you
[00:34.297]I watch you (And I watch as things play out like)
[00:39.932]So long nice to know you, I'll be moving on
[00:45.740]We started off in such a nice place
[00:48.379]We were talking the same language
[00:51.337]l open, and I'm closing
[00:54.066]You can't stand the thought
[00:55.745]Of a real beating heart, you'd be holding
[00:58.674]Having trouble, uh-oh, owning
[01:01.522]And admit that I am hoping
[01:05.435]I watch the moon
[01:09.770]let it run my mood
[01:12.338]Can't stop thinking of you
[01:16.914]I watch you (And I watch as things play out like)
[01:22.479]So long nice to know you
[01:24.443]I'll be moving on
[01:28.253]Moving on
[01:53.626]You, yeah I always know the truth
[01:57.304]But I can't just say it to you
[02:00.389]Yeah. I know the truth
[02:04.677]I knew, yeah I always knew the truth
[02:06.206]But I can't just say it to you
[02:08.306]Yeah. I know the truth
[02:10.916]I never thought we'd see it through
[02:16.616]I never could rely on you
[02:19.868]And a few times your face came
[02:22.875]Into view
[02:23.884]Into view
[02:25.711]I'm not into you
[02:33.194]into view
